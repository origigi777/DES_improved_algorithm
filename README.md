# DES_improved_algorithm
an improved version of the DES security algorithm

I fixed the DES algorithm by extending the keys option for protecting from Brute FORCE attacks (slows the attacker)

my code runs twice :
1. regular run
2. run and compare the Encrypted messages of the 2 rounds

the purpose is to show the  avalanche effect of this implementation
of DES 

I hope it will give inspiration to students for projects or understanding the idea of the algorithm.
I left remarks inside the code for better understanding
